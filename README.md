# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard – Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases an interactive **Power BI dashboard** developed to analyze **Hospital Emergency Room (ER) operations**.  
The dashboard enables hospital administrators to monitor patient flow, waiting times, admissions, and demographic trends to improve operational efficiency and patient experience.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
Emergency rooms often experience:
- High patient inflow during peak hours
- Long waiting times
- SLA breaches in patient attendance
- Uneven department referrals

**Objective of this dashboard:**
- Track key ER performance indicators
- Identify operational bottlenecks
- Improve SLA compliance
- Enhance patient satisfaction
- Support data-driven decision making

---

## 📊 Key KPIs
- **Total Number of Patients**
- **Average Waiting Time (minutes)**
- **Patient Satisfaction Score**
- **Patients Attended Within SLA (%)**

---

## 📈 Dashboard Analysis

### 1️⃣ Patient Volume Analysis
- Displays total ER visits for selected year and month
- Helps identify peak and low-traffic periods
- Supports time-based trend analysis

---

### 2️⃣ Average Waiting Time Analysis
- Measures patient waiting duration before being attended
- Highlights delays affecting patient experience
- Supports staffing and shift optimization

---

### 3️⃣ Patient Satisfaction Analysis
- Tracks overall patient satisfaction score
- Helps correlate waiting time with patient experience
- Important quality and service metric

---

### 4️⃣ Gender-wise Patient Distribution
- Breaks down ER visits by gender
- Supports demographic-based analysis
- Useful for healthcare planning and reporting

---

### 5️⃣ Patient Admission Status
- Compares admitted vs non-admitted patients
- Indicates ER burden on inpatient services
- Helps detect avoidable ER visits

---

### 6️⃣ SLA Compliance – Patients Attended Within Time
- Shows percentage of patients:
  - Attended within defined SLA
  - Delayed beyond SLA
- Critical for performance monitoring

---

### 7️⃣ Department Referral Analysis
- Displays number of patients referred to:
  - General Practice
  - Orthopedics
  - Cardiology
  - Physiotherapy
  - Gastroenterology
  - Neurology
  - Renal
- Helps identify high-demand departments

---

### 8️⃣ Age Group Analysis
- Distribution of patients across age groups:
  - 0–9, 10–19, 20–29, 30–39
  - 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79
- Supports age-specific care planning

---

### 9️⃣ Patient Race Analysis
- ER visit distribution by patient race
- Supports diversity, equity, and compliance reporting
